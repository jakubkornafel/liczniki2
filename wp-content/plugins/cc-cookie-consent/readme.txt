Cookie Consent Plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

**WP/CC Cookie Consent**

WordPress unofficial Silktide Cookie Consent plugin.

It is designed to help you comply with the EU Cookie Law and not make you want to kill yourself in the process. So we made it fast, free, and relatively painless.
Original javascript plugin developed by Silktide

**Why required this plugin for my site?**

From October 2015 a new privacy law came into effect across the EU. The law requires that websites ask visitors for consent to use most web cookies.
More information please read this: [EU Cookies Law](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm)

**Why Cookie Consent?**

*Free & open source*

You're forever free to copy, modify and even sell Cookie Consent.

*Lightweight*

Just 3.5k when minified, and you don't need JQuery or anything else.
